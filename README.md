# [Project 1: Deep Learning for Real Estate Price Prediction](https://github.com/JStLouisCode/Deep-Learning-for-RE-Price-Prediction)
- Utilized deep learning techniques to develop an accurate model for predicting real estate prices from a given dataset.
- Leveraged data visualization techniques such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to gain valuable insights into the relationships between real estate price and key features.
- Implemented the model using Python and various libraries such as Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Conducted data preprocessing and feature engineering to optimize the model's performance.
- Evaluated the model's predictions using metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R2, ensuring its accuracy and effectiveness.

# [Project 2: Bank Application GUI](https://github.com/JStLouisCode/Bank-Application-GUI-)

- Windows Forms application that provides a graphical user interface for managing banking transactions in C#. 
- Users can transfer funds between different types of accounts, including chequing accounts and a savings account.
- Users can view and update their personal information, including their name, address, and postal code.
- Users can perform transactions with payees, although the exact nature of these transactions is not specified in the provided code.
- The application is designed with visual styles enabled to provide an enhanced user interface experience.

# [Project 3: Library Management System](https://github.com/JStLouisCode/Library-Management-System)

- Python-based command-line application designed to help users efficiently manage a library of books.
- Features include loading book data, adding/removing books, searching by criteria, retrieving book categories, and sorting based on different attributes.
- System provides a user-friendly interface through the command-line, ensuring easy navigation and interaction.
- Robust and flexible solution using efficient algorithms that allows users to organize and access their book collection, saving time and effort.


# [Project 4: Cheap-Flight-Finder](https://github.com/JStLouisCode/Cheap-Flight-Finder)
- Automates the process of finding the cheapest flights on Expedia using the Selenium, Pandas, and Schedule libraries.
- Automatically searches for the cheapest flights based on specified departure and arrival locations, as well as the desired travel dates.
- Retrieves flight details such as airline, departure time, arrival time, and price.
- Filters the search results to display only nonstop flights sorted by the lowest price.
- Sends an email with the relevant flight information to the specified recipient.
