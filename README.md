# Project 1: Cheap-Flight-Finder
The "Cheap Flight Finder" program is a Python script that uses the Selenium module to automate the process of finding the cheapest flights available on Expedia. The program inputs the departure airport, destination airport, and date of travel and returns the cheapest flights on Expedia for a one-way trip. The program also sends an email with the flight details.
