# [Project 3: Deep Learning for Real Estate Price Prediction](https://github.com/JStLouisCode/Deep-Learning-for-RE-Price-Prediction)
- Utilized deep learning techniques to develop an accurate model for predicting real estate prices from a given dataset.
- Leveraged data visualization techniques such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to gain valuable insights into the relationships between real estate prices and key features.
- Implemented the model using Python and various libraries such as Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Conducted data preprocessing and feature engineering to optimize the model's performance.
- Evaluated the model's predictions using metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R2, ensuring its accuracy and effectiveness.

# [Project 7: Cheap-Flight-Finder](https://github.com/JStLouisCode/Cheap-Flight-Finder)
- Automates the process of finding the cheapest flights on Expedia using the Selenium, Pandas, and Schedule libraries.
- Automatically searches for the cheapest flights based on specified departure and arrival locations, as well as the desired travel dates.
- Retrieves flight details such as airline, departure time, arrival time, and price.
- Filters the search results to display only nonstop flights sorted by the lowest price.
- Sends an email with the relevant flight information to the specified recipient.
